KDE Users:
----------
Typically you will NOT want the qt5-styleplugins (even if timer isn't installed)
on your system as that will supercede KDE's settings.  Even having the qt5ct
commented out in .bashrc is not enough.


XFCE/Box Window Manager Users:
------------------------------
(1) If you want to us the inbuilt themes of Timer, you need not do anything
special. Just select an apropriate theme from the wizard invoked by the system
tray icon menu. Profit!

(2) If you want to use native theming from XFCE:

(a) You will want to install the qt5-styleplugins package.

(b) edit your ~/.bashrc file with:
        QT_QPA_PLATFORMTHEME=qt5ct

(c) log in/out of desktop session.

(d) execute 'qt5ct' from terminal and select gtk2 style.

Now Timer will inherit theme changes from qt5ct and use the same theming as
your XFCE desktop environment.


General:
--------
Slackware includes many sound files in /usr/share/sounds if you do not like
the inbuilt pop.wav sound.
